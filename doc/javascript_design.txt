JQuery
------
Bird-a will use JQuery and JQuery UI as standard javascript libraries. These libraries will be
included by bird-a in the final generated html.

All JQuery plugins should be added to the "vendor/jquery" folder. Every other library should be
added to "vendor" directory. It is important to use, wherever possibile, the library version
in the file or folder filename and create a symbolic link to that with the name without the
version number.
