Python Templating
-----------------

At the time this choice was made (17/11/2014), there are a lot of competing python templating libraries.

The chosen one is Jinja (http://jinja.pocoo.org/). It presents:
- Good popularity: is the most frequently suggested library at the time in forums and communities
- Active development
- Good features set
- Linear syntax
- Honest performance
